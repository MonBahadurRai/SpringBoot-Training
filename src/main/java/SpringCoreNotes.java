     * Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle and a fundamental concept in software engineering, particularly in the context of object-oriented programming and frameworks like Spring. It refers to a pattern where the control over the flow of a program's execution is shifted from the program itself to an external framework or container.

     * In traditional programming, your application code often directly controls the creation and management of objects and their dependencies. With Inversion of Control, this control is inverted or "flipped," meaning that the framework or container takes over the responsibility of managing objects' lifecycles, creating dependencies, and injecting them where needed.

     * There are two main types of Inversion of Control:
     *
     *     Dependency Injection (DI):
     *     Dependency Injection is a specific implementation of Inversion of Control. It involves providing the necessary dependencies (objects or resources that a class depends on) from the outside, rather than having the class create its dependencies itself.
     *
     *     There are three common types of dependency injection:
     *         Constructor Injection: Dependencies are provided through a class's constructor.
     *         Setter Injection: Dependencies are set using setter methods on the class.
     *         Method Injection: Dependencies are passed to specific methods when they are called.
     *
     *     In Spring, for example, you define your components and their dependencies, and the Spring container manages the creation and injection of these dependencies.
     *
     *     Control Inversion:
     *     Control Inversion is a broader concept that includes Dependency Injection but also encompasses other aspects where control is shifted from your application to a framework. This can include things like event-driven programming, where the framework calls your code in response to events, as well as other design patterns like the Template Method Pattern or the Hollywood Principle ("Don't call us, we'll call you").
     *
     * Inversion of Control has several benefits, including:
     *
     *     Decoupling: It promotes loose coupling between components, making it easier to replace or update individual components without affecting the entire system.
     *     Testability: Components are easier to test in isolation since you can provide mock or stub dependencies.
     *     Reusability: Components become more reusable since they are not tightly coupled to specific implementations of their dependencies.
     *     Modularity: The application's structure becomes more modular and easier to manage.
     *     Flexibility: It allows you to configure and adapt the behavior of your application without modifying its code.
     *
     * Frameworks like Spring heavily rely on Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection to achieve these benefits and make development more efficient and maintainable.
